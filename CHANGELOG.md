## 2.0.1 (2013-07-11)

Bugfixes:

 * Added locking support as per the original plugin. Now the raptor can't be triggered again while it's currently animating. Raptors [can pick locks](http://xkcd.com/135/), but they are slowed by them.

 * Raptors
 * Modernizr support for audio feature detection
 * Compatibility with latest jQuery
